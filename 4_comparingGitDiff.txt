Git Diff
We can use the git diff command to view changes between commits,
branches, files our working directory and more!

We often use fit diff alongside commands like git status and git log,
to get a better picture of a repository and how it has changes over
time.

Without additional options, git diff lists all the changes in our working
directory that are NOT staged for the next commit.
Compares staging area and working directory
git diff

List all changes in the working tree since your last commit
git diff HEAD

Will list the changes between the staging area and our last commit.
"show me what will be included in my commit if I run fit commit right now"
git diff --staged
or
git diff --cached

We can view the changes within a specific file by providing git diff
with a filename.
git diff HEAD <filename>
or
git diff --staged <filename>

will list the changes between the tips of branch1 and branch2
git diff branch1..branch2
or
git diff branch1 branch2

to compare one file between two diferent branches
git diff branch1 branch2 <filename>

To compare two commits, provide fit diff with the commit hashes of the
commits in question.
git diff commit1..commit2
or
git diff commit1 commit2
