to merge one branch into another, we need to be into receiving branch 
this to attemp a fast forward merge
git switch <receiving-branch>
git merge <merging-branch>

sometimes is necesary when merge, to add a 'merge commit' this happens
when the <receiving-branch> has more commits than the <merging-branch>
this commit, git do it automatically if doesnt have any conflicts

Resolving conflicts
Whenever you encounter merve conflicts, follow these steps:

1.-Open up the file(s) with merge conflicts.
2.-Edit the file(s) to remove the conflicts. Decide which branch's content
you want to keep in each conflict. Or keep the content from both.
3.-Remove the conflict 'markers' in the document.
4.-Add your changes an then make a commit!
