Checkout
to view a previous commit
We just need the first 7 digits of a commit hash
git checkout <commit-hash>

When we checkout a particular commit, HEAD points at that commit rather than at the branch
pointer.

Detached HEAD
You have a couple options:
1.Stay in detached HEAD to examine the contents of the old commit.
Poke around, view the files, etc.
2.Leave and go back to wherever you were before - reattach the HEAD.
3.Create a new branch and switch to it. You can now make and save changes, since HEAD is
no longer detached.
