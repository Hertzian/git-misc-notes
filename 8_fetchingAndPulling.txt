To view all the remote branches
and this show all the branches in remote repo
git branch -r

When you put:
git status
Appears a message of my actual branch, and with what
remote branch has relation, if they have commits ahead or if
my branch is up to date.

I'm be able to se the content of the remote branches with
git checkout <remote>/<remote-branch>
BUT is with detached HEAD

The easyest way to switch and makes a local branch with the 
same content than the remote, and track the remote branch is:
git switch <remote-branch-name>

The old way of doing this is:
git checkout --track <remote-name>/<remote-branch-name>

Fetching

Fetching allows us to download changes from a remote
repo, BUT those changes will NOT be automatically
integrated into our working files.

It let syou see what others have been working on, without
having to merge those changes into your local repo.

Think of it as "please go and get the latest info from 
github, but don't screw up my working directory"

To fetch branches and history from a specific remote repo,
and only updates tracking branches.
git fetch <remote>
If not especified, <remote> defaults to origin
And this fetch the ENTIRE remote

Can also fetch a specific branch from a remote using:
git fetch <remote> <branch-name>
This only fetch the remote branch

fetch:
-get changes from remote branch(es)
-updates the remote-tracking branches with new changes
-does not merge changes into your current HEAD branch
-safe to do at anytime

Pull

(this is just an example)
git pull = git fetch + git merge
Update the remote tracking branch with the latest changes from remote
Update current local branch with remote tracking branch

To pull a particular remote an branch
git pull <remote>/<remote-branch> <local-branch>
Like merge, it matters WHERE we run this command from.

Without specifying a particular remote or branch to pull from,
git assumes:
- remote branch will default to origin
- branch will default to whatever tracking connection is
configured for your current branch.
git pull

note:
This can be configured and tracking connections,
most people don't do this

pull:
-get changes from remote branches
-updates the current branch with the new changes, merging them in
-can result in merge conflicts
-not recommended if you have uncommitted changes
